# BTFixer
A simple script that fixes current and future usermaps with Harry BO21's BT lines.


## Prerequisites:
- [Harry BO21's "BT Stuff" pack from DEVRAW.](https://www.devraw.net/releases/bt-stuff-presets)
- Move `_hb21_zm_behavior.gsc` from the above pack into `Call of Duty Black Ops III/share/raw/scripts/zm`.

## Executable (shid_bt.exe)

  - Drag & drop your `Call of Duty Black Ops III` folder onto `shid_bt.exe`.
     - You may also open `shid_bt.exe` and drag & drop or manually type the path.

  - If you didn't drag and drop, hit ENTER.
     The tool should apply the necessary lines to all GSC and zone files.

  - Hit ENTER to close the tool.


## Python script (shid_bt.py)
  Same as above, just replace `shid_bt.exe` with `shid_bt.py`.
